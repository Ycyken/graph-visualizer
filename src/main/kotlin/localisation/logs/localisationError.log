[Текст песни «+7(952)812»]

[Интро]
Это второй
А
That's a Krishtall
Ау-у, YEEI, а

[Припев]
52 (Алло)
Да здравствует Санкт-Петербург (А), и это город наш (YEEI)
Я каждый свой новый куплет валю как никогда (YEEI, а)
Альбом, он чисто мой, никому его не продам (Он мой)
Не думаю о том (YEEI), как хорошо было вчера (А-а; мне пох)

[Куплет]
Меняю города (А)
Представляю район — у меня есть репертуар (YEEI, 2-3)
Никогда не просил, но всегда где-то доставал (Где?)
Чем больше денег (А), тем больше мне нравится Москва (А)
Но в Питере душа (YEEI), в Питере семья (YEEI)
В Питере братва (А, а), там знают наши имена (52)
+7(952)8-1-2 (Алло)
Это второй альбом (А), вторая глава (Второй)
Не думал, не гадал, всё, что я делал, — рэповал (Всегда)
Андеграунд — это не броуки в протёртых штанах (Пошёл на хуй)
Нужно прожить мою жизнь, чтоб так же, как я, слагать (Ага)
Нужно мой рэп услышать (YEEI), чтоб точно его понять

[Припев]
52 (Алло)
Да здравствует Санкт-Петербург (А), и это город наш (YEEI)
Я каждый свой новый куплет валю как никогда (YEEI, а)
Альбом, он чисто мой, никому его не продам (Он мой)
Не думаю о том (YEEI), как хорошо было вчера (Ага)

[Аутро]
Да здравствует 52
Да здравствует Петербург, да здравствует 52
Да здравствует Петербург, да здравствует 52 (Ау; YEEI, а)
Да здравствует 52 (Ау), YEEI, long live (Это второй)
